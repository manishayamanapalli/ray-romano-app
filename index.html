                    <h2> Jamie Floyd: Upper West Side Classic 6 </h2>
                    <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8
                        weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no
                        choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!" </p>
                    <h2>Donna and Scott: Rescued Renovation </h2>
                    <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real
                        artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another
                        "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!" </p>
                    <h2>David Siegel: Doubled the Value </h2>
                    <p> "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than
                        doubled the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any
                        person looking to make home improvements." </p>
